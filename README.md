    03..How do you attach an event handler using the onclick attribute in HTML?
             The onclick attribute in HTML is used to attach a function or action to an element, like a button, so that when the element is clicked, a specific task happens. For example, you can use onclick="alert('Hello!')" inside a button tag, and when the button is clicked, it will show a pop-up message. It allows you to run JavaScript code when a user interacts with an element.    

   04..What is the difference between onclick and addEventListener()?
              The main difference is that onclick can only attach one event handler per event type, while addEventListener() can attach multiple event handlers for the same event type.
